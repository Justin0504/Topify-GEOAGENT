# Content Planning and Calendar Creation

## Pillar Content Strategy

### What is Pillar Content
Pillar content is a comprehensive, in-depth piece of content that covers a broad topic. It serves as the foundation (hub) for related content pieces (spokes) that dive deeper into specific subtopics.

### Hub-and-Spoke Model
- **Hub (Pillar)**: Main comprehensive content piece
- **Spokes (Cluster)**: Related detailed content pieces
- **Internal Linking**: Connect all pieces together
- **Topic Authority**: Build expertise in specific area
