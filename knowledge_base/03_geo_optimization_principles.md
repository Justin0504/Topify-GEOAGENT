## Principle 2: Question-Oriented Content Structure

### Why It Matters
AI engines are designed to answer questions. Content structured around questions performs better.

### Best Practices
- Use question-based headings (e.g., "What is GEO?")
- Include FAQ sections
- Address common user questions directly

- Provide step-by-step guides

### Example Structure
```

## How to [Action]?
## Common Questions About [Topic]
```

## Principle 3: Clear Hierarchy and Logic

### Content Organization
- Use clear heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Logical flow from general to specific
- Related topics grouped together
- Easy navigation and scanning

### Structure Guidelines
- **H1**: Main topic (one per page)
- **H2**: Major sections
- **H3**: Subsections
- **Lists**: For multiple related points
- **Tables**: For comparative data

## Principle 4: Natural Keyword Integration
